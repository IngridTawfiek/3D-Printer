#3D-Prototyping-Machine -  Software to Control a Resin-Based 3D Prototyping Machine
A C# program to control a resin-based 3D prototyping machine built primarily using a projector and two stepper motors housed within a custom-made wooden structure.

This was my University group project for the last year of my degree in Biomedical and Systems Engineering at Cairo University, for which we achieved an A-grade.

While the code is quite simple, the majority of our effort was spent building the rig, and experimenting with the resin setting process. You can watch a video showing a demo of the machine we built here: https://youtu.be/70jM5vB0b54

The program requires installation of the Kitware Visualization Toolkit (VTK), available here: http://www.kitware.com/opensource/vtk.html
